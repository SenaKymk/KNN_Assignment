# üë• Gender Prediction Using KNN in Java

This is a Java-based desktop application that predicts gender (Male/Female) using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) and supports CSV-based dataset loading.

## üß† Algorithm

The application uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm, a widely used supervised machine learning method for classification problems. It predicts the label of a new instance by analyzing the 'k' closest data points from the training set and performing a majority vote.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Load a CSV dataset that includes labeled examples (e.g., height, weight, shoe size, and gender).
2. The system converts each row into a `DataPoint` object.
3. When a user inputs new feature values, the algorithm:
   - Calculates the distance to every training data point
   - Selects the k nearest neighbors
   - Predicts the most frequent gender label among them
4. The predicted gender is displayed on the GUI.
